### The task

Please can you make a one-page app that takes a messy list of Unix file paths and builds a UI that will display the tree to the user as shown in the attached example screenshot (please let me know right away if the image didn't make it through to you). *Please use vanilla JS (or Typescript if you prefer) and CSS (no frameworks or libraries).*

### What we're looking for:

-	Please provide a working solution that can run in the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome.
-	You should aim to visually replicate the layout style shown in the screenshot as closely as possible.
-	Please give consideration to readability, accuracy/correctness, and edge cases.

### Once you've finished...

Please upload the folder to a cloud file share such as Dropbox/Gdrive/Onedrive/iCloud & send me a link. Please *do not* upload your solution to a public Github repository.
